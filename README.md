# Youtube Transcript Summarizer

This project showcases a system designed to extract and analyze text YouTube video transcriptions. In this project a fine-tuned model will provide you a summary for a certain duration , which will provided by the user.


## Features

- Provide summary for a the given transcription
- Provide the content for user specified duration

### Note & issues:
- This project isn't complete because of lack data.
- I have firstly trained the mode using the transcription (.txt) and then fine-tuned using the json file which contents the the duration . The fine-tuned model needs lots of train .
- The accurasy may be low.
- I have firstly tried to train the model with certain words such as end , ending ,finish , close , closure , termination for understanding the context to the model. Due to lack of experience that didn't turned well.
